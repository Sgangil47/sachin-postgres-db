Hello reader, this file contains the details of postgres database session number: 3rd

create table employees (empid serial primary key, empname varchar, salary int, designation varchar, gender varchar)
	This query will create a table employees with the mentioned attributes
	
select * from employees where salary > 2000 or gender='M' and id =3;
	This query will find out those employees having salary > 2000 or (gender = 'M' and id = 3)
	
select gender, count(*) from employees group by gender;
	This query will find out the number of male and number of female employees.
	  -Note: 
	  	You need to specify all those columns in group by clause that we are going to be select.
	  	As in the above query we are selecting gender column thus we specify gender column in group by clause. 
	  	If we select more colimns then we have to mentione them in group by clause also, which is called nested grouping
	  
select designation, gender, count(*) from employees group by designation, gender;
	This is the example of nested grouping.
	this query will firstly group by designation and after that it will group by gender
	
select * from employees order by id;
		or
select * from employees order by 1; //1 specify the first column of given table. It will sort the result according to first column.
	-Both query are same and will give same output.
	-order by clause is used to sorting the result.
	-If we do not specify the order then default sorting order is ascending order.
	
select * from employees order by salary desc, gender limit 3;
	This query will output top 3 employees getting highest salary.


We have to explore enum data type and all the operators available in postgres.
