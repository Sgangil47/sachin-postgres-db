# Kubernetes For Absolute beginners
### What is Kubernetes?
- kubernetes is an open source container management tool which automates container deployment, container scaling and load balancing.
- It schedules, runs, and manages isolated conatiners which are running on virtual/physical/cloud machines.
- All top cloud providers support kubernetes.

### History of kubernetes
- Google developed an internal system called `borg`(later named as omega) to deploy and manage thousands google applications and services on their cluster.
- in 2014, google introduced Kubernetes an open source platform written in `Golang` language and later donated to **CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)**.

### Online Platform for Kubernetes (K8s)
- kubernetes playground
- Play with k8s
- Play with kubernetes classroom

### Cloud Based k8s Services
- GKE Google Kubernetes Services
- AKS Azure Kubernetes Services
- Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Services)

### Kubernetes Installation Tool
- Minicube
- Kubeadm

### Problem with Scaling Up the containers
- Containers cannot communicate with each other.
- Autoscaling and Load balancing was not possible 
- Containers has to be managed carefully.

### Features of Kubernetes
1. Orchestration (clustering of any number of containers running on different network).
2. Autoscaling (Vertical and Horizontal both).
3. Auto- Healing.
4. Load balancing.
5. Platform independent (cloud/virtual/physical).
6. Fault Tolerance (Node/Pod failure).
7. Rollback (going back to previous version).
8. Health monitoring of conatiners.
9. Batch execution (one time, sequential, parallel).
